# digit-neural-network

This project is a simple Python script designed to train a digit recognition model using a graphical user interface (GUI). The model currently recognizes digits from 0 to 6, but its accuracy is relatively low due to limited training data. I'll work on the dataset later to improve it.

## Features:

### 1. **Train Option**  
   - Use this option to train the digit recognition model.  
   - The current model recognizes digits from 0 to 6. Adding more data to the training set will help improve accuracy.  
   - Once trained, you can continue to refine the model as more data becomes available.

### 2. **Test Model Option**  
   - Use this option to test the model and check its accuracy.  
   - If the model guesses correctly, you have the option to confirm the guess. These confirmed guesses will be saved, helping to enhance the model’s accuracy in future training sessions.

## Installation and Setup:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/digit-neural-network.git
cd digit-neural-network
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the ***main.py*** script
```bash
python main.py
```


## Notes:
- Due to the limited dataset, the model’s accuracy may be low, but additional training data will help improve it over time.  
- Future updates to the dataset and GUI are planned to enhance accuracy and functionality.
